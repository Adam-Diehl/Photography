Recently I've had the opportunity to demo a friend's mirrorless camera. An oft touted feature of this new style of cameras is the electronic viewfinder (EVF), which replaces the standard optical viewfinder found on DSLRs. EVFs are 'what you see is what you get' displays - you can see how your exposure compensation (or other adjustments) will look before you take the picture. However, this means that your preview of the shot you're about to take is constrained by the resolution on your EVF (on a fairly small screen to boot). When using autofocus this isn't much of an issue. However when using manual focus lenses (like the old Pentax lens below) this presents a serious problem. Your ability to focus the lens is limited by what you can see on the screen.

I frequently ran into the issue of seeing what I thought was an in focus image on the EVF only to find a picture just ever too out of focus to be salvageable in post or, when using particularly shallow DoF, a picture with the focus on the wrong side of the image. When using optical viewfinders this isn't an issue as you're seeing through the lens itself (well, plus or minus a mirror or two), rather than a tiny digital representation. For standard photography this is unlikely to be a common problem - most of your shots will be with autofocus enabled. For cinematography, however, manual focus is virtually mandatory meaning a calibration error would result in potentially ruined takes. As EVFs improve this issue will diminish, but in the meantime manual shooters should keep an eye out for focus issues with their mirrorless bodies.
